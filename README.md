# Shopping List

Shopping List is a simple React Native application that works on getting the
basics down to start create mobile applications. All thanks to Traversy Media
for the guidance.

## Installation

Must have Android Simulator (android studio) or iOS Simulator (xcode).
Download files, run npm install, then within the directory run the command ->
npm run android or npm run ios.
